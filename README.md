# St Margaret's Centre Access Database

This repository is designed to serve as both a record of the development process of the Access database, so that it can be handed over if necessary, and as a single solution for issue tracking and documentation (via the wiki).

## Getting started with the database

There is a set of instructions on how to download and link the front-end database available [here](https://github.com/bamiesking/st-margaret/wiki/Getting-started). The interface is intended to be relatively intuitive, however walkthroughs for common process flows will gradually be added to the wiki, so that is the first place to look if you're stuck. 

## Reporting issues

If and when the database throws errors or features don't work as intended, GitHub repositories have a built-in Issue tracker (view it [here](https://github.com/bamiesking/st-margaret/issues)). If you encounter an issue, please record it there and provide as much information as possible (error code and message *at the very least*)

## Common errors

Nothing to put here currently (thankfully), although I'm sure that will change soon.
