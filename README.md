# St Margaret's Centre Access Database

This repository is designed to serve as both a record of the development process of the Access database, so that it can be handed over if necessary, and as a single solution for issue tracking and documentation (via the wiki).

## Getting started with the database

There is a set of instructions on how to download and link the front-end database available [here](https://github.com/bamiesking/st-margaret/wiki/Getting-started). The interface is intended to be relatively intuitive, however walkthroughs for common process flows will gradually be added to the wiki, so that is the first place to look if you're stuck. 

## Reporting issues

If and when the database throws errors or features don't work as intended, GitHub repositories have a built-in Issue tracker (view it [here](https://github.com/bamiesking/st-margaret/issues)). If you encounter an issue, please record it there and provide as much information as possible (error code and message *at the very least*)

## Common errors

**Run-time error 3044** - ensure you have removed preexisting linked tables from the 'Linked Table Manager' in the 'External Data' tab - click [here](https://github.com/bamiesking/st-margaret/wiki/Removing-linked-tables) and follow the steps.

**Run-time error 2501** - redownload the latest release from [here](https://github.com/bamiesking/st-margaret/releases) and follow the steps [here](https://github.com/bamiesking/st-margaret/wiki/Getting-started) to link it to your local back-end. If the error still arises, open an issue [here](https://github.com/bamiesking/st-margaret/issues/new).
